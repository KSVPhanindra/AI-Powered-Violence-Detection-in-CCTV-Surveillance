# AI-Powered Violence Detection in CCTV Surveillance  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on detecting violent activities in CCTV surveillance footage using deep learning techniques. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, it aims to enhance public safety by providing real-time alerts for suspicious or violent behavior.  

## üîç Features  
- *Automated Violence Detection*: Identifies violent actions from CCTV footage.  
- *Deep Learning-Based Model*: Utilizes CNNs and RNNs for accurate classification.  
- *SmartCity CCTV Violence Detection Dataset*: Trained using the SCVD dataset.  
- *Real-Time Processing*: Capable of real-time inference for quick alerts.  
- *Scalability*: Can be integrated into existing security systems.  

## üõ† Tech Stack  
- *Programming Language*: Python  
- *Frameworks & Libraries*: TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas  
- *Dataset*: SmartCity CCTV Violence Detection Dataset (SCVD)  
- *Deployment*: Flask/FastAPI for API integration  

## üìÇ Dataset  
The SmartCity CCTV Violence Detection Dataset (SCVD) from Kaggle serves as the primary dataset, containing labeled video clips for violent and non-violent actions.
